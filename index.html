    <h2>WHO ARE WE?</h2>
    <div class="intro">
        Canberra Modern is an annual program of events
        showcasing Canberra's unique mid and late twentieth
        century places and spaces. 

        Our motto is 'Conservation Through Participation'
        and our innovative events aim to increase awareness
        of Canberra's modernist character, heritage and uniqueness.

        Through event-based advocacy and
        engagement with the community, Canberra Modern
        aims to promote protection and appreciation of the
        places which make an irreplaceable contribution to
        Canberra's historic urban and designed cultural landscape.

            <h3>What's so special about Canberra?</h3>
            Canberra is a young city with a rich architectural legacy. 
            With major boom periods in the 1920s and again from the 1950s-1980s - the architectural 
            aesthetic of the city is eclectic, but deliberately cohesive.  <br> <br>

            The mid-late twentieth century period of development in Canberra, 
            specifically during the National Capital Development Commission's (NCDC) oversight 
            (1958-1989) has not been widely celebrated or recognised by the Canberra community. <br> <br>

            Major developments not only in residential, but civic and community 
            buildings saw the frequent involvement of architects now considered pioneers of the modernist 
            movement, and the construction of a key collection of iconic and unique mid-century buildings in Australia. <br> <br>

            Many of these structures, which make an 
            irreplaceable contribution to Canberra, have already been 
            lost and many face risk of being lost in the near future.  <br> <br>

            So we at Canberra Modern are here to help 
            by engaging Canberra and Australia with their 
            contemporary National Capital.
